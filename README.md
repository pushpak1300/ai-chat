# AI Chat - Laravel Starter Kit

A modern AI chat starter kit built with Laravel, featuring real-time streaming responses using Prism, Inertia.js, Vue.js, and TailwindCSS.

## Introduction

Prism Chat provides a solid foundation for building AI-powered chat applications with Laravel. It leverages Laravel's powerful ecosystem combined with the [Prism PHP SDK](https://prismphp.com/) to deliver real-time streaming responses, creating a dynamic and engaging user experience.

## Features

- **Real-time AI Responses**
  - Replies stream back to the browser as soon as they are produced, making conversations feel smooth and natural.
- **Reasoning Support**
  - Designed for models that can keep context and perform multi-step reasoning for more powerful interactions.
- **Multiple AI Providers**
  - Works with popular services like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, Ollama, Groq, Mistral, DeepSeek, xAI and VoyageAI. Configure any or all of them in your `.env` file.
- **Authentication System**
  - Users can register, log in and manage their own chat history using Laravel's built‑in authentication.
- **Appearance Settings**
  - Light and dark mode are supported out of the box and follow your system preference automatically.
- **Custom Theming**
  - Tweak a handful of CSS variables and every Shadcn component in the UI will instantly reflect your branding.
- **Chat Sharing**
  - Create shareable links so others can view a conversation or continue chatting from where you left off.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Laravel 12.x, Prism PHP SDK
- **Frontend**: Vue.js 3, Inertia.js 2.x
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS 4.x, Shadcn components
- **Database**: SQLite (configurable to MySQL/PostgreSQL)
- **Authentication**: Laravel Sanctum
- **Real-time**: Server-Sent Events (SSE)

## Prerequisites

- **PHP 8.3+** with extensions:
  - curl, dom, fileinfo, filter, hash, mbstring, openssl, pcre, pdo, session, tokenizer, xml
- **Composer 2.x**
- **Node.js 18+** and npm/bun
- **SQLite** (or MySQL/PostgreSQL if preferred)

## Installation

Installation can be done using the Laravel installer:

```bash
laravel new --using=pushpak1300/ai-chat my-ai-chat
cd my-ai-chat
```

Or using Composer:

```bash
composer create-project pushpak1300/ai-chat my-ai-chat
cd my-ai-chat
```

After installation:

```bash
# Install frontend dependencies
npm install

# Generate application key (if not done automatically)
php artisan key:generate

# Create database file (for SQLite)
touch database/database.sqlite

# Run migrations
php artisan migrate

# Start the development server
composer run dev
```

The `composer run dev` command runs multiple processes concurrently. If you encounter issues, run them separately.

## Configuration

### Environment Setup

Copy the example environment file and configure your settings:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### Theme Customization

The application uses Shadcn components with TailwindCSS for styling. To customize the theme:

1. Visit [tweakcn.com](https://tweakcn.com) to generate custom CSS variables
2. Update the CSS variables in `resources/css/app.css`
3. The changes will automatically apply to all Shadcn components

### AI Provider Configuration

**Note**: You don't need to configure all providers. The application will work with any combination of the providers you set up.

### Configuring AI Models

AI models are defined in the `app/Enums/ModelName.php` file. This enum defines which models are available in your application and their metadata.

#### Understanding the ModelName Enum

The [`ModelName` enum](app/Enums/ModelName.php) serves as the central configuration point for all AI models in your application. Here's how it works:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Enums;

use Prism\Prism\Enums\Provider;

enum ModelName: string
{
    // OpenAI Models
    case GPT_4O = 'gpt-4o';
    case GPT_4O_MINI = 'gpt-4o-mini';
    case O1_MINI = 'o1-mini';
    case O1_PREVIEW = 'o1-preview';

    // Anthropic Models
    case CLAUDE_3_5_SONNET = 'claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022';
    case CLAUDE_3_5_HAIKU = 'claude-3-5-haiku-20241022';
    case CLAUDE_3_OPUS = 'claude-3-opus-20240229';

    // Google Gemini Models
    case GEMINI_1_5_PRO = 'gemini-1.5-pro';
    case GEMINI_1_5_FLASH = 'gemini-1.5-flash';

    // Add more models as needed...
}
```

#### Adding New Models

To add support for new AI models, follow these steps:

1. **Add the Model Case**: Add a new case to the enum with the exact model identifier used by the provider:

```php
case NEW_MODEL = 'provider-model-name';
```

2. **Implement Required Methods**: Each model must implement several methods:

```php
public function getName(): string
{
    return match ($this) {
        self::NEW_MODEL => 'Human-Readable Name',
        // ... other cases
    };
}

public function getDescription(): string
{
    return match ($this) {
        self::NEW_MODEL => 'Brief description of model capabilities',
        // ... other cases
    };
}

public function getProvider(): Provider
{
    return match ($this) {
        self::NEW_MODEL => Provider::YourProvider,
        // ... other cases
    };
}
```

#### Editing Existing Models

If you want to modify an existing model or remove it from the list:

1. Open `app/Enums/ModelName.php` and locate the model case you want to change.
2. Update the case value or name along with the corresponding `getName`,
   `getDescription` and `getProvider` matches.
3. If you remove a case, delete it from the enum and from each of these match
   statements.
4. Save the file and run your tests to verify everything still works as
   expected.

## Security

### Reporting Security Issues

If you discover security vulnerabilities, please email [pushpak1300@gmail.com](mailto:pushpak1300@gmail.com) instead of using the issue tracker.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Provider not configured" errors:**

- Ensure the required API key is set in your `.env` file
- Verify the API key is valid and has sufficient credits/quota
- Check that the provider service is operational

**Streaming not working:**

- Verify your server supports Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- Check firewall settings for long-running connections
- Ensure proper CORS configuration for cross-origin requests

**Model not appearing in UI:**

- Confirm the model is added to `ModelName` enum
- Verify the provider is properly configured
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
